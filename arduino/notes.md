Arduino Liliypad Notes
======================
The conductive fabric sensor has been set up.
The resistance at rest is about 1.4MOhms
The resistance when fully extended is about 2KOhms
If we multiply these, and get the square root, we get a figure of 53KOhms
This is the resistance we need to put in series with the sensor to get the optimim range of readings at the LilyPad.
